			<p><h2>1. Background</h2></p>
            <p><td>The Knowledge Sharing Campaign (KSC) creates a platform that brings together two groups of people: the Know Can Teach those who have some experience and would like to share their knowledge) group and the Dont Know  Can Learn (those who would like to learn, but do not have the opportunity) group. KSC originated from a simple idea, which turned out to be its slogan: Bring, Share, and Learn. We believe that if these two groups come together, agree to bring and share the minimum required resources that facilitate learning, then KSC becomes an intersection between humanity and technology that provides a great platform to promote excellence in education. 
            KSC is based on two key principles that can be derived from the following quotes.</td></p>

            <p>Target Audience Kscs target group is made of African students. The campaign can be extended to any other student diaspora.</p>
            <p>KSC PROGRAMMES KSC as an educational platform, provides a series of programs which aim at equipping the youth with all required skills to embrace technology and develop their communities. </p>
            <p>1. Internship Programme</p>
            <p>hase 1 It is clear that African students face challenges to get internship opportunities, when they complete their studies outside the continent. There is a claim that their study permits will not allow them to participate in internship programmes. We understand the gap that exists between the skills set that African students possess after their graduation and the skills that are required by companies to hire them.</p>

            <p><li> Prioritise on students in final years</li></p>
