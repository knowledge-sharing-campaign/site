        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <br>These terms and conditions are divided into the following parts:<br>
        (A) a disclaimer of liability;
        <br> (B) terms and conditions governing the use of this website;
        <br> (C) a licence for our free legal documents;
        <br> (D) terms and conditions governing Lawlistic memberships;
        <br> (E) general and interpretive provisions.
        <br>
        <p>By using our website, you accept these terms and conditions in full. If you disagree with these terms and conditions or any part of these terms and conditions, you must not use our website. If you register with our website or buy any product or service from our website, we will ask you to expressly agree to these terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>Our website uses cookies. By using our website and agreeing to these terms and conditions, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of our privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>(A) General disclaimer</h3>
        <h4>(1) Legal information</h4>
        <p>Much of the legal information on this website consists of summaries of complex legal issues. Legal and factual details and nuances are inevitably omitted from such summaries. Particular circumstances often radically affect the law that applies, and the way that the law applies.</p>
        
        <p>You should therefore never apply the legal information to your own situation without conducting additional research or engaging a lawyer. Nor should you assume that all of the relevant legal material is included on our website.</p>
    
        <p>The law changes constantly, and legal information is always liable to become out-of-date.</p>

        <p>Most of the legal information on this website relates to the laws of England and Wales or the United Kingdom, or European Union law. However, this is not always the case. Do not assume that any particular item of legal information relates to any particular jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>For all of these reasons, you must not rely upon any information on this website, and we recommend that you take professional legal advice before embarking upon any course of action (or omitting to take any action) that has or may have legal implications.</p>

        <h4>(2) Exclusion of warranties, representations and guarantees</h4>
        We do not warrant, represent or guarantee:
        <p>the accuracy of the information published on this website;
            <br>the completeness of the information published on this website;
            <br> that the information published on this website is up-to-date;
            <br> or the information on the website can be applied to achieve any particular result. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law we exclude all representations, warranties and guarantees relating to this website and the use of this website (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill).</p>

        <h4>(3) Limitations and exclusions of liability</h4>
        <p>Nothing in these terms and conditions will: (a) limit or exclude our or your liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence; (b) limit or exclude our or your liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (c) limit any of our or your liabilities in any way that is not permitted under applicable law; or (d) exclude any of our or your liabilities that may not be excluded under applicable law.</p>

        <p>The limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Section and elsewhere in these terms and conditions: (a) are subject to the preceding paragraph; and (b) govern all liabilities arising under the terms and conditions or in relation to the subject matter of the terms and conditions, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.</p>

        <p>To the extent that the website and the information and services on the website are provided free-of-charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature.</p>

        <p>We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses arising out of any event or events beyond our reasonable control.
        <br> We will not be liable to you in respect of any business losses.
        We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss of or damage to profits, income, revenue, or anticipated savings.</p>
        <p>We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss of use or production.
        
        We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss of management time or office time.
        
        We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss of business, contracts, commercial opportunities or goodwill.
        
        We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss or corruption of any data, database or software.
          We will not be liable to you in respect of any special, indirect or consequential loss or damage.
        We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses arising out of any acts or omissions of any hosting services provider, payment services provider or other third party services provider.
        <p>You accept that we have an interest in limiting the personal liability of our LLP's members and employees. Having regard to that interest, you accept that we are a limited liability entity and agree that you will not bring any claim personally against individual members or employees in respect of any losses you suffer in connection with the website or these terms and conditions. This will not, of course, limit or exclude the liability of the LLP itself for the acts and omissions of our members and employees.</p>
        <h4>(4) Third party content</h4>
        <p>You acknowledge that some of the information published on this website is submitted or provided by users, law firm partners and other third parties, and that we do not usually review, approve or take editorial responsibility such information.

                <h4>(5) Website availability</h4>
                <p>From time to time the website or features of the website will be unavailable. Such unavailability may be the result of defects in the website software, scheduled or emergency maintenance procedures, or failures of third party service providers. We do not commit to ensuring that the website will be available at any particular time. Furthermore, we do not commit to ensure that the website will continue to be published in the future.</p>
                <h4>(6) Interactive features</h4>
                <p>Our website includes interactive features that allow users to communicate with us and our partner law firms. You acknowledge that, because of the limited nature of such communication, any legal assistance you may receive using any such facility is likely to be incomplete and may be misleading. Any legal assistance you may receive using any such facility does not constitute legal advice and accordingly should not be relied upon. No solicitor-client or attorney-client relationship shall be created through the use of our website.</p>
                <h4>(7) ContractAlert and other notification services</h4>
                <p>The ContractAlert service we provide is primarily intended to highlight changes in the law that may affect the drafting of contracts. However, neither it nor our other notification services are intended to be comprehensive, and they should not be treated as a comprehensive contract news or update services. We may discontinue the ContractAlert in our sole discretion at any time.</p>

                <br> (a) any SEQ Legal law firm partner;
                <br> (b) any supplier of any legal document or documents made available on our website;
                <br> (c) any supplier of other legal content made available on our website; and
                <br>(d) any officer, employee, partner or member of any person referred to in sub-paragraphs
                <br>(a) to (c). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8 shall not affect the terms of any solicitor-client or attorney-client relationship expressly agreed and entered into between a website user and any law firm.<br>

                    <h3>(D) Lawlistic terms and conditions</h3>
                    <h4>(13) Memberships</h4>
                    <p>The terms and conditions in this Part D apply between us, SEQ Legal LLP, and all Lawlistic members, including free members, business members and professional members. The use of a membership account on our website shall be limited to:</p>
                    (a) members; and
                    <br>
                    (b) in the case of corporate members, officers and employees of the member. Members must ensure that no other persons use, or have access to, their accounts on the website.
                        
                            <br>
                            A membership shall begin at the time and on the day that we grant the member access to Lawlistic member services, and shall continue until terminated in accordance with this Part D.
                            <br>
                            We may in our absolute discretion refuse any application for membership.
                            <br>
                            <h4>(14) Charges, payments and credits</h4>
                            <br>The charges shall be as specified on our website from time to time. We may vary the charges in our sole discretion at any time, by posting the varied charges on the website. If the member does not wish to pay charges at the new level, the member's sole remedy is to terminate the membership in accordance with the terms of this Part D. All charges are stated exclusive of VAT, unless the context requires otherwise.
                    
                            <br>
                            Before a membership commences, the member must pay to us:
                            (a) the applicable sign-up charges; and
                            <br>
                            (b) the first calender month's (pro-rated) recurring charges. On the first day of each calendar month during the term of the membership, the member must pay to us the applicable recurring charges for that month. Members may also be permitted to purchase top-up credits at any time (see below). Charges must be paid by such method as we may request from time to time.
                            <p>
                            Professional services are priced in credits on the website. If specified on the website in relation to the relevant type of membership, the member shall accrue credits during the continuation of the membership in accordance with this paragaph. Upon the commencement of the membership, the amount of monthly credits specified in the membership description shall be awarded to the member, pro-rated to reflect the amount of the recurring charges paid upon sign-up. Upon the payment of the recurring charges thereafter, the full amoung of the monthly credits specified in the membership description shall be awarded to the member.</p>
                            
                            We may vary the charges for the purchase of top-up credits and/or the credit-based pricing of professional services in our sole discretion at any time, by posting the variations on the website. If the member objects to such variations, the member's sole remedy is to terminate the membership in accordance with the terms of this Part D. Credits may expire at the end of such period following purchase as we may specify on the website from time to time, providing that the minimum period shall be 12 months following purchase.
                            <br>
                            <h4>(15) Member services</h4>
                            <br>We may vary the benefits available to members, and the terms of this Section 18, at any time in our sole discretion.
                            <br>
                            During the period of membership, a member shall be able to access all such template legal documents as are covered by the membership, subject to the other provisions of these terms and conditions.

                            <br>

                            <br>
                             (c) questions are subject to limits specified in relation to the relevant membership;
                            <br>
                             (d) we will have no obligation to provide guidance relating to complex points of law or matters outside our expertise;
                            <br>
                            (e) we will have no obligation to provide guidance where we consider that it creates a material risk of liability or potential liability on our part; and
                            <br> (f) guidance may be provided in summary form and may consist of a recommendation to seek legal advice. All guidanace given throught the Q&A system is subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out in Part A.</p>

                            <h4>(16) Licence to use templates</h4>
                            <p>In this Section 20, "Templates" means the legal templates that are available to members via our website; "Derivatives" means adapted versions of Templates that do not include any of the footnotes or editing guidance (indicated by italic text, upper case text and/or square brackets) in the templates; and "Relevant Clients" means arm's-length clients paying for your website design or website development services at a market rate.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>We own the intellectual property rights in the Templates. Subject to the licence below, all our intellectual property rights are reserved.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you are a member and benefit from an "own business" licence, we grant to you a worldwide non-exclusive non-transferable non-sublicenseable licence to make any Permitted Use of any Template available under your membership; providing that you must not in any circumstances make any Prohibited Use of any such Template.</p>
                            
                            <p>The "Permitted Uses" are:</p>
                             (a) downloading copies of each Template;
                            <br>
                            (b) storing, viewing and editing Templates and Derivatives on any computer owned or controlled by you;
                            <br>
                             (c) publishing Derivatives on an unlimited number of websites owned and controlled by you;
                            <br> (d) printing an unlimited number of copies of any Derivative.
                            <br> The “Prohibited Uses” are:
                            <br>
                            <br> (a) the sale, licensing, sub-licensing, renting, leasing or commercial distribution of any late or Derivative in any format;
                            <br>(b) the publishing of any Template (excluding the publication of a Derivative as expressly permitted above);
                            <br>(c) the use of any Template or Derivative in any way that is unlawful or in breach of any person's legal rights under any applicable law, or in any way that is offensive, indecent, discriminatory or otherwise objectionable;
                            <br> (d) the use of any Template or Derivative to compete with us, whether directly or indirectly;
                            <br> (e) deleting, obscuring or removing, any copyright notices or other proprietary notices placed by us on any Template or Derivative.
                            <br>
                            If you are a member and benefit from an "own business + clients" licence, then in addition to the rights specified above in relation to "own business" licences, you shall have the right to sub-license to your Relevant Clients the right to make Permitted Uses of Templates and Derivatives, subject always to the prohibition of the Prohibited Uses and the other provisions of these terms and conditions. Sub-licences must be in writing. You may in your sole discretion charge your clients fees in respect of such licences. If you grant any sub-licence to a client, you must notify us using our sub-licence notification form within 30 days of the date of grant of the sub-licence.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>If you breach any of these terms and conditions, then your licences under this Section may be terminated by us upon written notice to you. Upon the termination of a licence set out in this section, you will promptly and irrevocably delete from your computer systems and other electronic devices all copies of the Template(s) and Derivative(s) in your possession or control, and will permanently destroy any paper or other copies of the Template(s) and Derivative(s) in your possession or control.</p>
                            
                            <h4>(17) Termination of membership</h4>
                            <p>Memberships may be terminated:</p>
                            <br> (a) by the member at any time giving us written notice of termination;
                            <br> (b) by us giving at least 30 days' written notice to the member; or
                            <br> (c) if the member is insolvent, or fails to pay any applicable charges on the due date, or breaches any provision of these these terms and conditions, or breaches the terms of any other contract between us and the member - by us giving immediate written notice to the member.
                            
                            <p>Free memberships may be terminated by us giving you written notice of termination at any time, with or without explanation.</p>
                            
                            <p>If a membership is terminated (for whatever reason and on whatever basis) the member shall not be entitled to any refund of any amounts paid to us before such termination. Nor shall the member be released from liability to pay any amounts that were overdue for payment as at the date of termination. Credits held by the member at the data of termination shall be lost.</p>
                            
                            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if a legal template is downloaded by the member during the period of a membership, the licence to use that template shall continue indefinitely beyond the end of the membership period, subject to termination of the licence upon breach in accordance with Section 19 or Section 23.</p>
                            (18) Indemnity
                            
                            <p>You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute) incurred or suffered by us arising out of any breach by you of any provision of these terms and conditions, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms and conditions.</p>
                            
                            <h4>(19) Breaches of these terms and conditions</h4>
