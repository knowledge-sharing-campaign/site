(A) General disclaimer
(1) Legal information
Much of the legal information on this website consists of summaries of complex legal issues. Legal and factual details and nuances are inevitably omitted from such summaries. Particular circumstances often radically affect the law that applies, and the way that the law applies.

You should therefore never apply the legal information to your own situation without conducting additional research or engaging a lawyer. Nor should you assume that all of the relevant legal material is included on our website.

The law changes constantly, and legal information is always liable to become out-of-date.

Most of the legal information on this website relates to the laws of England and Wales or the United Kingdom, or European Union law. However, this is not always the case. Do not assume that any particular item of legal information relates to any particular jurisdiction.

For all of these reasons, you must not rely upon any information on this website, and we recommend that you take professional legal advice before embarking upon any course of action (or omitting to take any action) that has or may have legal implications.

(2) Exclusion of warranties, representations and guarantees

We do not warrant, represent or guarantee:

the accuracy of the information published on this website;
the completeness of the information published on this website;
that the information published on this website is up-to-date;
or the information on the website can be applied to achieve any particular result.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law we exclude all representations, warranties and guarantees relating to this website and the use of this website (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill).

(3) Limitations and exclusions of liability

Nothing in these terms and conditions will: (a) limit or exclude our or your liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence; (b) limit or exclude our or your liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (c) limit any of our or your liabilities in any way that is not permitted under applicable law; or (d) exclude any of our or your liabilities that may not be excluded under applicable law.

The limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Section and elsewhere in these terms and conditions: (a) are subject to the preceding paragraph; and (b) govern all liabilities arising under the terms and conditions or in relation to the subject matter of the terms and conditions, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.

To the extent that the website and the information and services on the website are provided free-of-charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature.

We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses arising out of any event or events beyond our reasonable control.

We will not be liable to you in respect of any business losses.

We will not be liable to you in respect of any loss of or damage to profits, income, revenue, or anticipated savings.

We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses arising out of any acts or omissions of any hosting services provider, payment services provider or other third party services provider.
You accept that we have an interest in limiting the personal liability of our LLP's members and employees. Having regard to that interest, you accept that we are a limited liability entity and agree that you will not bring any claim personally against individual members or employees in respect of any losses you suffer in connection with the website or these terms and conditions. This will not, of course, limit or exclude the liability of the LLP itself for the acts and omissions of our members and employees.
