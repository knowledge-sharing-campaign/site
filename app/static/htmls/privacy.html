        <h3>PART C: COOKIES</h3>
        <h4>(13) About cookies</h4>
        <p>Our website uses cookies. You consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies consist of small files, often including unique identifiers, that are sent by web servers to web browsers, and which may then be sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and to identify users returning to a website.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
        
        <h4>(14) Cookies on this website</h4> 
        We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on this website.
        <br>
        <h4>(15) How we use cookies</h4>
        <p>Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but personal information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
        
        <p>We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        
        <p>(1) to recognise your computer when you visit our website;</p>
        
        <p>(2) to track you as you navigate our website, and to enable the use of the some of the features on our website (such as our shopping cart, Q&A system, and blogging and commenting system);</p>
        
        <p>(3) to improve the website’s usability;</p>
        
        <p>(4) to analyse the use of our website;</p>
        
        <p>(5) in the administration of this website;</p>
        
        <p>(6) to personalise our website for you, including targeting advertisements which may be of particular interest to you.</p>
        
        <h4>(16) Third party cookies</h4>
        <p>When you use our website, you may also be sent third party cookies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.
